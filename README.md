# MyoAndLeap
The report at hand describes a model that might bring closer virtual reality to people without forearms. The model is identified using two devices, one of them it is the Myo armband to measure the superficial Electromyography (sEMG) of the upper arm of the subject, these signals are used as an input of the model. The second device is the Leap Motion that generates the output of the model, which is used to capture the different position (Pitch, Roll, and Yaw) of the forearm and hand in the three-dimensional space to close the loop of the model. After generating a Look-up-table (LUT) of the input and output signals, a general model is identified using Recursive Least Squares (RLS) to generate a parametric identification of the system. The found model has been tested, and shown that it could be feasible to replace the Leap Motion device by using only the Myo armband, using merely sEMG signals, which gives a hope to people without forearms who want to connect with human machine interfaces for playing games, and undergo virtual reality therapy for prosthesis design, among other applications.
